# oldagram

This project was inspired by and guided by the Essential CSS track from [Scrimba's Frontend Bootcamp](https://www.scrimba.com).

I updated some of the code, especially the rendering loops, from for loops to for.each loops and also added the liking functionality that changes the heart's color to red and also increases the like count.
